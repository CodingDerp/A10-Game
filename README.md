Smack a Mon!

This is a Java project by Steel Anderson and Braeden Christensen.

The idea of this project is to implement an application with at least;

3 classes

1 for loop

1 array/ArrayList

This comes with no warrenty whatsoever, and as it is mostly just for class/
amusement, should not be taken seriously.
